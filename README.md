This is project I wanted to do to help myself learn python, and to help my fellow classmates learn if they wished to.
Anyone is welcome to clone if they feel like practicing/learning python.

This was all coded in VSCode, i have current settings and extensions added to repository to try and make viewing easier.

You will need to add the "@" to settings.json for better comments. (I needed more comment colors, lol.)
    It is the last entry in the Current_settings_VScode.txt file.
